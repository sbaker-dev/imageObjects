Helper Objects for working with open computer vision and image projects

open cv python has contours, a extremely useful component that can be extracted from images. However, these components 
are in a ndarray format that can then be processed by a list of methods, rather than an object which has a list of 
methods. This library changes that around and allows for the contour extracted via open cv python to be placed in an 
object which can then be manipulated.
